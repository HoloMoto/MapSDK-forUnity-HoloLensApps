# MapSDK-forUnity-HoloLensApps

HoloLens 2 app project to introduce Japan using Microsoft Map SDK.

This is an experimental project for MapSDK application and UIUX.

　This project is my personal project, but is open to public.
　I am willing to accept suggestions and contributions.

# Enviroment

・Unity 2021.1.19f1

・UniversalRenderPipeline

・MixedReality Toolkit v2.7

・Microsoft Map SDK for Unity

# Original Function

## ・Get Youser's Location(※This feature has been integrated into Microsoft Maps-SDK for Unity.)

The user's current location is acquired via Wi-fi and reflected in the MapSDK coordinates.

※I am referring to this article.

## ・Culculate 2 points Distance in Maps
 
Calculate the distance from the latitude and longitude between your current location and a point on the map.

## ・It displays the direction of a certain point from the current location in 3D. (*Under development)

As a unique feature of xR maps, the direction of a certain country from the current location is displayed in three dimensions, assuming the earth is a perfect sphere.

　For example, if you start the app in Japan and select a region in South America, the arrow will point straight down.

# Objectives and goals of this project

The goal of this project is to eventually release it on the Microsoft Store.

This app is designed to make your travel in Japan more enjoyable.

We also intend to make it function as an educational content.
